# 21-Days-of-Building-a-Small-Language-Model


This repository is a curated collection of articles, resources, and learning material from my **21 Days of Building a Small Language Model** series.

The goal of this series is simple:  
👉 **Understand how modern language models work by building one step by step, from scratch.**

Instead of jumping straight into massive models, we focus on **foundations first**—math, data, GPUs, tokenizers, attention mechanisms, and real-world performance optimizations.
